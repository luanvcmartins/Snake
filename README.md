# Snake!

This is project for the UFMS's 2016 APSOO class, in which the students where tasked with developing a classic game (we chose snake). One of the most challenging aspects of this task was that the game must be developed in Java Swing, a tool completely inapropriated for the task at hand.

This project is interesting because it showcase the team (mainly me and Julio Cesar)'s effords to create a interesting gaming experience while dealing with the limitations of the technology.

## Features

The following features are in this build:

- **Story mode**: plays the levels in sequence.
- **Training mode**: gives the player a empty level in which he can learn the game while the speed increases.
- **Play level**: the player can choose a level to play directly.
- **Build level**: one of the coolest feature was the hability for the player to build its' own levels using a tool on the game itself.
- **History**: allows the user to check previously played games and the best scores.

## Wanna test?

Download the project's content and run the `Snake2.jar` from the root folder.

## Where does the music comes from?

Mostly from **GTA V**'s soundtrack. I obviously don't have the rights to, but it is meant just as a school project from years ago.

## Why share?

While the project itself is rather silly, it shows the developer's experience in build Java Swing apps, as well as the efford put in creating interesting user experience, even in a simple school project.
